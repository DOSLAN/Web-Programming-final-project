# What this application does
It will ask you to enter "row" and "column". After you press submit, it will go to a blank page that will shine with colors.

# How to use it
Take your friends. Find 16 phones. Place them on a table 4X4. Every phone must go to this site, and submit row and column (coordination of this phone). After this you should see 16 phones combined **animation**.
