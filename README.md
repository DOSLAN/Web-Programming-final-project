# What this application does
It will ask you to enter "row" and "column". After you press submit, it will go to a blank page that will shine with colors. 
Take your friends. Find 16 phones. Place them on a table 4X4. Every phone must go to this site, and submit row and column (coordination of this phone). After this you should see 16 phones combined **animation**.
## Mentions. 
* When you press the "submit" button, if your written values not submitted, and they have disappeared, don't worry, probably you submitted wrong values, try again. It works like that. Yeah, it would be nice if there will appear the text "try again" but I did not have time to finish it, sorry.
* Make sure when shining screen loaded refresh the page about three times. When it loads it calculates the time to start animation to animate synchronously with others, If it loads longer there will be some milliseconds gone between calculation is done and animation start so it will animate late so not synchronously. The second and third refreshes will load faster.
